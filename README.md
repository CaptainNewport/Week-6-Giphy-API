# Week-6-Giphy-API
This code is for the Giphy API homework. I have psuedo coded the start and stop functionality as I didn't complete that. I also have bugs when making the buttons to call new gifs. The new buttons append with the correct elements, attributes, ID's and classes so I think it has something to do with the placement of the "document.ready" statements.

The gifs pulled are images right now but I am familiar enough with the API that I can change the images back to gifs... if I hard coded it...
